"""
Functions used to combine a list of features into one coherent one.

Sample use:
1. to convert categorical to numerical, we perform a one hot encoding
2. treat each binary column as a separate numerical feature
3. compute numerical features as usual
4. use each of the following functions to create a new feature
   (with the input as the nth feature for each of the columns)

WARNING: these will be used in various locations throughout the code base
and will result in feature size growing at faster than a linear rate
