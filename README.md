CauseEffectPairsPaper
=====================

A few utility scripts for running experiments for a paper in a declarative function. Simply create one or several autocause config files in the configs directory, run the `apply_config.py` script to create some features, then run `score.py` to score those features.

Feel free to read results.txt and do a diff between a few config files to see the differences in predictive performance on a small dataset.
